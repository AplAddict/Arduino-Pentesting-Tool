Arduino MKR 1000 Pentesting Tool

## Description
  My capstone project is a pentesting tool to showcase computer vulnerabilities and teach people how to secure their devices. This runs on an Arduino MKR1000. In the future, I hope to use an Arduino Uno, USB Host Shield, two Bluetooth Chips, and a joystick too add more features. Ideally it will be four devices in one: A WiFi Bad USB/USB Rubber Ducky, a WiFi Keylogger, a WiFi Deauther, & a Bluetooth mouse.
  Currently, I have an initial version of the WiFi Bad USB up and running with a nice web interface and many features. Iâ€™m having issues with input fields running sending extra commands to the target.
  In the future, I hope to make it a WiFi deauther which uses the IEEE 802.11 protocol to send deauthentication frames to disconnect a client from WiFi. I also looked into using ARP Spoofing instead. I will be adding a USB Host Shield so you can plug a keyboard in and record what the user types. Also, I plan on adding a Bluetooth chip to communicate with the Uno that contains a joystick so that I can hijack mouse functionality. I thought of adding a keyboard however it is too bulky. I may add an input on the web interface allowing you to type anything on the computer. This is easy as long as I can figure out the text input bug.
  Hopefully, this project will be able to show people how vulnerable their devices are and how they can prevent these types of malicious attacks. [Watch our video.](https://github.com/AplAddict/Arduino-Pentesting-Tool/blob/main/Images&Videos/video.mov)

  ## Market Research
  Currently, our main competitors are the [Malduino Bad USBs by Maltronics](https://maltronics.com/collections/malduinos). They have two different versions the Malduino and the Malduino W. However, this Arduino Pentesting Tool is clearly better than the competitions. Take a look at how they mach up.
  ### Bad USB Comparison
  #### Arduino Pentesting Tool
  - Has over 30 scripts pre coded (great for non-tech savy users)
  - Scripts can be changed and run wirelessly through the WiFi web console
  - No computer needed everything can be done using a smart phone or any device with a search engine
  - No micro SD Card needed
  - Has a replacable cord so that you can hide it out of sight.
  - Costs around 33$ to make.
  #### Malduino
  - Only holds 3 scripts
  - Scripts need to be coded
  - Needs a computer in order to upload scripts
  - Needs to be taken apart and then a switch has to be flipped to change the script that is currently running
  - Needs a micro SD Card
  - Has no cord so it is harder to hide.
  - Costs over $39.00
  #### Malduino W
  - Holds many scripts
  - Scripts need to be coded
  - Scripts can be changed and run wirelessly through the WiFi web console
  - Scripts can be uploaded 
  - No micro SD Card needed
  - Has no cord so it is harder to hide.
  - Costs over $61.00
